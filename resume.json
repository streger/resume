		"summary": "I come from Požega, Croatia, and currently I live in Zagreb. I have studied Faculty of Geodesy, Master of Science in Engineering in Zagreb and in Novi Sad but never graduated from either one. From early childhood I have played with computers and similar technologies, from hardware assembly to software programming (and almost anything in-between). I'm a huge geek especially for new technologies and I like to be abreast with latest software and hardware product solutions. I enjoy working on open-source projects and advocating for privacy and freedom friendly tools and software.",
